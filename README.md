# laboratorio-de-datos

This repository is a compilation of all the excercises that i've done while doing the course "Laboratorio de Datos" (Data Laboratory) in the University of Buenos aires.
Here you can find how tools related to data analysis are used in many diferent fields, the goal is to highlight the importance of certain python libraries and how a good workflow involving data compilation, usage of data bases and tools of data processing can yield pretty amazing results.
Some of the files that i've used are too big to upload to github, if you're interested in the resources you can contact me!
